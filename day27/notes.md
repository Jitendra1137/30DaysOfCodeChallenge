# difference between high level  and low level lanuage 

High-level and low-level languages are two categories of programming languages that differ in terms of their abstraction level and their proximity to the hardware. Here's a short and sweet explanation of the difference:

1. **High-Level Language**:
   - **Abstraction Level**: High-level languages are closer to human language and are more abstract. They provide a higher level of abstraction from the hardware.
   - **Ease of Use**: They are easier to read, write, and understand, making programming more user-friendly.
   - **Portability**: Code written in high-level languages is generally more portable across different computer systems.
   - **Examples**: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript.

2. **Low-Level Language**:
   - **Abstraction Level**: Low-level languages are closer to machine code and are less abstract. They provide a lower level of abstraction from the hardware.
   - **Control**: They offer more direct control over the hardware resources of a computer.
   - **Efficiency**: Code written in low-level languages can be more efficient but is often harder to write and maintain.
   - **Examples**: Assembly language, machine code.

In summary, high-level languages are more user-friendly and abstract, making programming easier but potentially less efficient. Low-level languages provide more control and efficiency but are less user-friendly and more closely tied to the hardware. The choice between them depends on the specific needs of a programming task.



# is js is high level or low level language

JavaScript is considered a high-level programming language. High-level languages are designed to be easy for humans to read and write, and they provide abstractions that make it easier to work with complex tasks. JavaScript fits this definition because it has a relatively simple and human-readable syntax, and it abstracts many low-level details of computer hardware, such as memory management.

Low-level languages, on the other hand, are closer to the hardware and provide less abstraction. They often require more manual management of system resources and are generally more challenging to work with compared to high-level languages.

JavaScript is typically used for web development and runs in web browsers, providing a high-level interface to interact with web pages and handle user interactions. While it may not be as low-level as languages like C or Assembly, it is certainly not as high-level as some other languages like Python or Ruby. JavaScript is considered a mid-level language in the sense that it balances abstraction with performance and control.
