Certainly, I can provide a more theoretical overview of ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and its key features.

**ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)** is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript language specification, which is the standardized core of JavaScript. It was released in 2015 and introduced several significant enhancements and new features to the JavaScript language. These features were designed to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability while also making it more powerful and expressive. Here's a theoretical overview of some of the key ES6 features:

1. **Block-Scoped Variables (`let` and `const`)**:
   - `let` and `const` were introduced to allow block-level scoping for variables, helping prevent variable hoisting issues.
   - `let` allows for variable reassignment, while `const` creates variables that cannot be reassigned.

2. **Arrow Functions**:
   - Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for defining functions.
   - They have a lexical `this`, making it easier to maintain the value of `this` within functions.

3. **Template Literals**:
   - Template literals allow you to embed expressions inside strings using backticks.
   - They provide a more flexible and readable way to create strings with dynamic content.

4. **Default Parameters**:
   - ES6 allows you to specify default values for function parameters, simplifying function calls when some arguments are optional.

5. **Destructuring Assignment**:
   - Destructuring enables you to extract values from arrays and objects using concise syntax.
   - It simplifies variable assignment and function parameter handling.

6. **Classes**:
   - ES6 introduced a class syntax that provides a more structured way to define and work with objects in an object-oriented manner.

7. **Spread and Rest Operators**:
   - The spread (`...`) operator allows you to spread the elements of an array or object into another array or object.
   - The rest (`...`) operator collects remaining elements into a single variable.

8. **Promises**:
   - Promises were introduced to simplify asynchronous programming, making it more readable and manageable.
   - Promises represent a value that might not be available yet but will be at some point.

9. **Modules**:
   - ES6 introduced a module system with `import` and `export` statements for organizing and encapsulating code.
   - Modules facilitate better code organization and reusability.

10. **Map and Set**:
    - `Map` is a data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs, where keys can be of any data type.
    - `Set` is a data structure for storing unique values, eliminating duplicates.

These ES6 features collectively enhance JavaScript's capabilities, making it more versatile, maintainable, and easier to work with for developers. They have become standard practices in modern JavaScript development, and subsequent versions of the language have continued to build upon the foundation laid by ES6.
